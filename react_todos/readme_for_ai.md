I'll add functionality to make todo items editable on double-click.

I've made the following changes:

1. Added inline editing functionality:

   - Double-click a todo item to enter edit mode
   - Edit title using an input field
   - Change status using a dropdown select
   - Save and cancel buttons for editing actions

2. New features:

   - Added state for tracking which item is being edited
   - Added states for edited title and status
   - Added handlers for saving and canceling edits
   - Prevented status toggle while editing

3. Enhanced styling:
   - Added styles for editing mode
   - Styled input fields and select dropdown
   - Added save and cancel buttons with icons
   - Added cursor pointer to indicate items are editable

To use the editing feature:

1. Double-click any todo item
2. Edit the title and/or status
3. Click the check mark to save or X to cancel

Would you like me to:

1. Add animations for the edit mode transition?
2. Add validation for the edited title?
3. Allow editing the date as well?
4. Modify the editing mode styling?
